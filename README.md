# React Guess the Number Game

A simple and fun number guessing game built with React to demonstrate fundamental concepts like state management and component props.

## 🌟 Description

This is a mini-project that challenges a user to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 10. The application provides real-time feedback, telling the user if their guess is higher or lower than the secret number, or if they've guessed it correctly.

The primary goal of this project was to practice and showcase basic React skills, including:
- **State Management** with the `useState` hook.
- **Component-Based Architecture** by separating the main logic (`App.js`) from the UI result (`Result.js`).
- **Handling User Input** and events in React.
- **Passing Data** between components using props.

## 💻 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Styling:** Basic CSS

## ✨ Features

- Generates a random number on each page load.
- Accepts user input for their guess.
- Provides instant feedback: "Higher," "Lower," or "Correct!"
- Simple, clean, and intuitive user interface.
